Analysis of socioeconomic factors affecting GCSE performance in England


### Overview

This project investigates how neighborhood deprivation and local socioeconomic disadvantage affect studentsâ€™ academic outcomes in England. Using publicly available GCSE results from secondary schools and complementary datasets (e.g., Free School Meal eligibility, deprivation indices), the analysis explores the relationship between educational attainment and socioeconomic conditions.

### Objectives

Gather and integrate compulsory datasets from the Department for Education and open sources (GCSE outcomes, FSM eligibility, deprivation measures).
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to evaluate the influence of socioeconomic factors on exam performance.
Visualize findings using clear, interpretable plots.
Provide insights that could guide policy-making and resource allocation in education.

### Methodology

1) Data Collection: Government open data portals.
2) Data Cleaning & Integration: Standard preprocessing steps (handling missing values, merging multiple datasets).
3) Analysis: Correlation studies, regression models, and predictive modeling.
4) Visualization: Charts and plots to illustrate relationships between deprivation and academic outcomes.

### Tools & Technologies

1- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
2- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
3- Dataset Sources: UK Department for Education, local government repositories

### Expected Outcomes

Clear evidence of the correlation between socioeconomic deprivation and GCSE performance.
Statistical models quantifying the strength of these relationships.
Visual dashboards summarizing findings.
